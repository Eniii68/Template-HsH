# Images folder (pictures)

This folder is for images, this can be pictures,created graphs, sketches or circuit diagramms. It is recommended to work with `.png` and `.pdf` filetypes for inclusion
in the main document, but files needed by the respective editors may also be stored here.

# Image creation with Inkscape

Inkscape is a amazing vectorgraphics tool with an export to LaTex feature. I highly recommend it for creating complex images like sketches of
experimental setup.
