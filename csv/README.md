# CSV folder (Comma Seperatet Values)

This folder is for measurement readings and other kinds of data collection.  
It is named *csv*, but you could also use different filetypes, even though the `.csv` type is the easiest to include in LaTex.

# Export Excel to CSV

Excel ist a gerate tool for collecting and doing calculation on measured data, but is not so good for using that data in other tools. Thats why there
is a VBA macro, that makes it super easy to export excel-sheets into separate CSV documents, which can be used in Latex and easily reexported on
changes in the excel file.
