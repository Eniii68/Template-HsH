# SVG-Folder

The svg format is widely used for webgraphics and vectorgraphics. This makes it usefull for creating complex graphics and illustrations.

# Image creation with Inkscape

Inkscape is a amazing vectorgraphics tool with an export to LaTex feature. I highly recommend it for creating complex images like sketches of
experimental setup.
