% # INFO:
% this file will produce a few warnings, even when working correctly:
% - using fallback Bibtex backend, cased because of the older backend, which may not support all features
% - Bad type area setting, caused by using a landscape page. The type area is malformed, but this is no problem if you only include external pages


% # choosing a document class:
% The command below is the first one you will see in pretty much any LaTeX document. It sets up the so called documentclass,
% which is what determines all of your styling and sets up loads of stuff for you. In general there are classes for pretty much
% every type of document you could need, but this project provides a few classes specialized for the Hochschule Hannover.
% You can find information about the classes and the options in the README, but here is an example setup with load of comments:
\documentclass[	%----------------------Preamble---------------------------------------------------%
		fontsize=11pt,  % fontsize
		a4paper,	    % papersize
		%twoside,		% double sided layout
		english,		% document language (also numberingsystem)
		%ngerman,		% document language (also numberingsystem)
		sans,			% font type (sans/roman)
		f1,				% HsH facultie (f1-f5)
		%draft			% quicker compilations, images are not included
	]{HsH-report}		% documentclass


% # the preamble:
% everything between `\docuemtnclass' and `\begin{document}' is called the preamble. Here you configure all settings for your document.
% The `\documentclass' command is actually part of that configuration. Lets see what you could do here:


% # packages
% To extend LaTeXes basic functionality, you can load additional packages. Some are already loaded, but others you load in as needed.
% Check the README about what's already loaded and what's recommended.
% Also, this classfiles automaticly check for a file called `config.tex', in which you can collect common configurations and reuse them across
% files in this and/or multiple projects. If you use the full template from GitLab, it provied a `config.tex' which only applies the settings,
% if the corresponding package is loaded, making it even more reusable.
%
% Here are some packages we are going to need with some explanations:
\usepackage{color}		% for colouring stuff
\usepackage{siunitx}	% units
\usepackage{listings}	% including formated code snippets
\usepackage{csvsimple}	% for importing CSV files
\usepackage{subfigure}	% for subfigures
\usepackage{soul}		% strikethrough text
\usepackage{amssymb}	% for spectial Math symbols
\usepackage{enumitem}	% more list options
\usepackage{lipsum}		% dummy text


% # bibliography
% While you can just create a super simple bibliography directly in your documents and format it completely yourself (see <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#Embedded_system>)
% it is far more manageable and consistent to use a system called BibTeX, which allows you to maintain a file of all your sources and takes care of all
% the formatting for you. It also figures out which sources you use in your documents and only prints these, allowing for a single bibliography file
% you can use on multiple/all your projects. You can also create bibliographies on a chapter basis, if you prefer.
% To use it, just load the according package in your preamble, as shown below.
% Be aware that you need to run a separate program (`bibtex' or`biber') on your latex file for your citations to be rendered. But you usually don't
% need to run that every time.
% Also while this example is set up to use `bibtex' (because it is the default in loats of editors), the defaul for this project is the more modern
% `biber' command, so you need to change your editor accordingly if you omit the `backend=bibtex' option below:
\usepackage[backend=bibtex]{biblatex}

% now we load our bibliography file. Open it to see what it looks like
\addbibresource{bib/localBibliography.bib}


% # document information
% In your preamble you also list your documents information and metadata. These will be used on the title-page as well as being available throughout
% the document. Additionally, these documentclasses set up the resulting PDF file with the appropriate Metadata.
% You can just delety any of this comands or leave them empty if you don't need it for a project.
% See the following examples and what they create in the PDF file:
\author{
	Max Mustermann,
	Mira Musterfrau
} % the author and matrikelnr commands could also be on a single line, this is just more readable
\matrikelnr{
	1234567,
	9876543
}
\titlehead{Found on GitLab}
\subject{Example Project}
\title{How to write in Latex}
\subtitle{A helpful guide to get started and to show some common use cases}
\date{\st{01.01.2020}\\\today}
\professor{your Professor}
\keywords{some, informative, keywords}


% Now that you are all set, let's begin with the actual content of the document.
% Don't forget the corresponding `\end{document}'!
\begin{document} %----------- beginning of document -----------------------------------------------

% for longer documents it is custom to have different numbering until the first page of actuall content.
% For that use this command to switch to Roman pagenumbers and turn off chapternumbers:
\frontmatter

% While you can of course create your own title-page, either with latex or externally, the easiest way is to use the build in command.
% These classes redefine it to include the HsH-logo (depending on the chosen faculty) and to use the additional data provided in the preamble.
% You can also use the optional argument to change the title-pages alignment to l,c or r:
\maketitle[c]

% this command is provided by these documentclasses. It creates a standard Text at the bottom of the page and a line to sign on for every author.
% You are not restricted to this exact position and can use it where ever you want in your document, if you prefer it at the back, but it there.
\declarationAuthorship

% # abstract
% sometimes you are required to also create an abstract. Use this environment for that.
% It will create a new page and a heading for you as well as indenting the whole text block a little.
% if you have provided keywords, they will also be put at the end of the abstract.
\begin{abstract}
	\lipsum[5-6]
\end{abstract}

% This command will create the table of contents (TOC).
% Keep in mind, that LaTeX can only now about things it has already read. For everything that follows, it relies on temporary files which are created
% on the fly. So the complete TOC will only be rendered after at leas two LaTeX runs.
\tableofcontents

% the following command is the counterpiece of the `\frontmatter' command.
% It resets pagenumbers so that the next chapter is the first with actuall content.
\mainmatter


% now we can begin with the actuall relevant content. So let'S beginn by creating the first chapter:
\chapter{Examples} \label{chap: one}
	{\color{red}red text} and {\color{blue}blue text} \\
	different subscripts: \normalsubscripts$R_t$ \upsubscripts$R_t$ \\
	using Units: $R=200\,\mohm + \SI{0.34567453}{\volt\per\metre} - 5\,\si{\second\per\metre\squared}$ \\
	some information\cite{laboranleitung:physik}\\
	german number: $3,5$ english number: $3.5$\\ % note changes when using ngerman document option


	\section{Using formulas} \label{sec: formula}
		a numberd formula:
		\begin{equation}
			\label{eq: einhalb} % always lable your stuff
			0,5=\frac{1}{3}
		\end{equation}
		\autoref{eq: einhalb} is nice, but how about multiple lines:
		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split} % you need do nest this
			x &= x^2+3 \\
			\Leftrightarrow 0 &= x^2-x+3 \\
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		and how could you align formulas?
		\begin{align}
			x_1 &= 6 &&|\;\mbox{mit } x \in \mathbb{N} \\
			x_2 &= 33+\abs{\frac{1}{4}} &&|\;x_1+3 \\
				&= 33,25 &&\mbox{| don't number everything} \notag \\
			x_3 &= 10^{22}
		\end{align}


	\section{using Units}
		For this the \lstinline{siunitx} package is used. It provides Macros for all units.
		\begin{equation}
			200\,\kg
		\end{equation}
		The space between a number and it's unit should be a protected half-space, which can be created in latex using \lstinline{\,} In the classfile
		siunits is set up to use a separate macro for each subunit, even for size-modifiers:
		\begin{equation}
			200\,\mm \cdot 2\,\volt
		\end{equation}
		Siunits also allows for reformatting of numbers as well as units. Use the \lstinline{\SI} and \lstinline{\si} macros for that:
		\begin{equation}
			e = \SI{1.602176634E-19}{\coulomb} % formats number + units, autospacing, transform to german comma
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\SI[exponent-to-prefix]{1e-6}{\metre}% you can also autocalculate prefixes
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			124\,\si[per-mode=fraction]{\kilo\metre\per\second\squared} % only units
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
			\num{0.0004}\,\lumen % only numbers,  \per and \squared do not work
		\end{equation}


	\section{using images}
		Images can just be imported and used in a float environment with a caption and a lable to reference it. (see \autoref{fig: random image})
		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{img/lorem-ipsum.jpg}
			\caption{just a random image}
			\label{fig: random image}
		\end{figure}\\
		You can also display two or more images together, using the \lstinline{subfigure} package. You can also resize or crop Images, as seen in
		\autoref{fig: resize} and \autoref{fig: croped}
		\begin{figure}
			\subfigure[a smaller Version]{\label{fig: resize}\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{img/lorem-ipsum.jpg}}
			\subfigure[a croped image]{\label{fig: croped}\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth, trim=5cm 0 5cm 0,clip]{img/lorem-ipsum.jpg}}
			\caption{some more images}
		\end{figure}

		Plots can be created directly with latex. It is recommended to do this in subfiles and just import the finished PDF pages. This speed us
		compilertimes by a lot. You should not change the size of precompiled images to keep fontsizes consistent.
		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics[page=2]{plt/examplePlot.pdf}
			\caption[centering]{a nice plot}
			\label{fig: plot1}
		\end{figure}
		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics[page=1]{plt/examplePlot.pdf}
			\caption{a area plot}
			\label{fig: area}
		\end{figure}

		\pagebreak
		Circuit diagramms can also be created using a package called \lstinline{circuitikz}. It is also recommended to get familiar with Inkscape which
		has a very good export to latex feature, as you can see in \autoref{subfig: svg}. If you use Inkscape, there is a list of all electrical
		symbols \href{https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Schaltzeichen_(Elektrik/Elektronik)}{here on wikipedia}. You can downlload them as
		\lstinline{.svg} files (not as png!) and just drag\&drop them into Inkscape.
		\begin{figure}
			\includegraphics{crc/exampleCircuit.pdf}
			\label{subfig: circuit}
			\caption{a circuit diagramm}
		\end{figure}

		\pagebreak
		Using Inkscape, you can create SVG-vector graphics and import them easily into Latex.
		\begin{figure}
			\def\svgwidth{0.3\textwidth} % define desired width
			\graphicspath{{svg/}} % Inkludepath needet for the inputed file, double curly brackets needed for unknown reason
			\input{svg/exampleSVG.pdf_tex} % input the Latexfile generated by inkscape
			\caption{A image created with Inkscape}
			\label{subfig: svg}
		\end{figure}
		\enlargethispage{4\baselineskip}

	\section{using tables}
		Tables are a little bit complicated in LaTex, but don't worry, here are some examples:
		\begin{table}
			\caption{a simple table}
			\label{tab: table 1}
			\begin{tabular}{r|l}
				A & B \\\hline\hline
				1 & 2 \\\hline
				3 & 4 \\\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}\\
		As you can see, tables are build using two nested environments. The \lstinline{table} creates a floate just like a \lstinline{figure} would.
		You can then just give it a caption and a lable.\\
		The \lstinline{tabular} environment creates the actual table. You need to devine the alignment for every column and give delimiters between
		lines. Each cell is ended by a \& and a newline is created as always. Using \lstinline{\hline} creates a vertical line after the row.\\
		Here is a more complex example:
		\begin{table}
			\caption{a bigger table}
			\begin{tabular}{r|c|r l|l}
				ID & NAME & Price & Currency & Stock \\\hline
				1 & Product A & 10 & EUR & 20 \\
				2 & Stuff & 1 & USD & 200 \\
				\multicolumn{2}{c|}{A cool Teddy} & 50 & EUR & 1\\\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}


	\section{lists and enumerations}
		This is a nested List:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item hallo
			\begin{itemize}
				\item temp
				\begin{itemize}
					\item temp
					\begin{itemize}
						\item temp
					\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		\pagebreak
		And this is a nice checklist:
		\begin{checklist}
			\item first
			\item urgent
			\begin{checklist}
				\item sub item
				\item and another
			\end{checklist}
			\item continue
		\end{checklist}



	\section{CSV files}
		\label{sec: messwerte}
		import a csv as table:
		\par % a par is needed before the autotabulat since the kernel update from 01.06.21
		\csvautotabular{csv/bsp.csv}\\

		or do it manually to get more control:
		\begin{table}
			\caption{a nice list of numbers}
			\begin{tabular}{c|c}
				first row & second row \\\hline\hline
				\csvreader[
					late after line=\\\hline,
					late after last line=\\\hline
				]{csv/bsp.csv}{}{number: $\csvcoli\,\metre$ & is not \csvcoliii}
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}


\section{formating code} \label{sec: code}
	use the listings package:
	% gobble removes the whitespace that is only in the latex code to make it look organised
	\begin{lstlisting}[language=c,gobble=8]
		#include <stdlib.h>
		#include <sdtio.h>

		int main(void) {
			printf("Hello World");
			return 0;
		}
	\end{lstlisting}
	% or input from external file:
	%\lstinputlisting[language=c]{main.c}

\include{chap/exampleChapter}
