%---------------------- the documentclass -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% using this command you confige the "look and feel" of your document.
% you can pass different options to configure common usecases
% the options are shown for clarity, but most of them are allready the default,
% so no need to pass them explicitly
\documentclass[
        faculty=f1,
        paper=a4,
        fontsize=11pt,
        fontfamily=sans-serif,
        language=english,
        parskip=never+,
        linespacing=single,
        twoside=true,
        todos=off,
        draft=false,
    ]{HsH-report}

%---------------------- the preamble ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% everything between `\documentclass' and `\begin{document}' is called the preamble. Here you configure all settings for your document.
% The `\documentclass' command is actually part of that configuration. Lets see what you could do here:

% ----- package loading -----
% first thing you do is declare all the packages you need for your document
% you can also pass options to this packages to configure their behavior
\usepackage{listings}  % for pretty-printing code snippets
\usepackage{soul}  % for strickesthough text
\usepackage{lipsum}  % for dummy text

% for some packages you also call some commands to configure them or your document
\lstMakeShortInline[language={[LaTeX]TeX}]|

% ----- document information -----
% In your preamble you also list your documents information and metadata. These will be used on the titlepage as well
% as being available throughout the document. Additionally, these documentclasses set up the resulting PDF file with
% the appropriate Metadata.
% You can just delete any of this commands or leave them empty if you don't need it for a project.
% See the following examples and what they create in the PDF file:
\author{
    Max Mustermann,
    Mira Musterfrau
} % the author and matrikelnr commands could also be on a single line, this is just more readable
\matrikelnr{
    1234567,
    9876543
}
\titlehead{Found on GitLab}
\subject{Example Project}
\title{How to write in Latex}
\subtitle{A helpful guide to get started and to show some common use cases}
\date{\st{01.01.2020}\\\today}
\professor{your Professor}
\keywords{some, informative, keywords}


% ----- document seperation -----
% If you split your document into seperate files using `\include',
% you can temporarily exclude not required files to save compiletime
% LATeX will still remember chapter-numbers, page-numbers and alike
% from the last run (but only if the temp files are still around)
% comment this in to use it:
%\includeonly{chap/startingAdocument}

%---------------------- beginning of document -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
% Now that you are all set, let's begin with the actual content of the document.
% Don't forget the corresponding `\end{document}'!
\begin{document}

    % for longer documents it is custom to have different numbering until the first page of actuall content.
    % For that use this command to switch to Roman pagenumbers and turn off chapternumbers:
    \frontmatter

    % While you can of course create your own title-page, either with latex or externally, the easiest way is to use the build in command.
    % These classes redefine it to include the HsH-logo (depending on the chosen faculty) and to use the additional data provided in the preamble.
    % You can also use the optional argument to change the title-pages alignment to l,c or r:
    \maketitle[c]

    % this command is provided by these documentclasses. It creates a standard Text at the bottom of the page and a line to sign on for every author.
    % You are not restricted to this exact position and can use it where ever you want in your document, if you prefer it at the back, but it there.
    \declarationofauthorship

    % sometimes you are required to also create an abstract. Use this environment for that.
    % It will create a new page and a heading for you as well as indenting the whole text block a little.
    % if you have provided keywords, they will also be put at the end of the abstract.
    \begin{abstract}
        If you need an abstract for your document, you can write it wherever you see fit by using the |\begin{abstract}...\end{abstract}|
        environment, like demonstrated here. It acts as an unnumbered chapter. You can choose if you want it in the TOC using the
        |abstract=totoc| and |abstract=nottotoc| options of the documentclass.

        If you prefere your abstract to be on a clean page, you can use |\thispagestyle{plain}| to get only a page number or |\thispagestyle{empty}|
        to get nor header or footer.

        If you use the |\keywords{list, of, keywords}| command in your preamble, the given keywords will also be printed here. You may use
        |abstract=nokeywords| as a documentclass option to disable this.
    \end{abstract}

    % this command will create the table of contents (TOC).
    \tableofcontents

    % the following command is the counterpiece of the `\frontmatter' command.
    % It resets pagenumbers so that the next chapter is the first with actuall content.
    \mainmatter

    % now we can begin with the actuall relevant content
    % you could just put all commands and content here,
    % but for larger documents it makes sense to split each chapter into a seperate file.
    % NOTE: you can use the \includeonly{} in the preamble to temporarily only work on a
    % small subset of the document.
    %
    % We include this files here:
    \include{chap/whatsLaTeX}
    \include{chap/startingAdocument}
    \include{chap/textFormating}
    % ATTENTION: you can NOT nest multiple `\inlcude' commands into each other.
    % You can use `\input' inside included files though


    % print list of figures and tables
    \listoffigures
    \listoftables
\end{document}
